Lotka-Volterra equations

K-Means Clustering 
 - create K animal prototypes, that will divide animals into these prototypes based on their closeness

Papers to consider:
Notes on the simulation of evolution
Grassland dynamics: an ecosystem simulation model.
Using the Unity Game Engine to Develop a 3D Simulated Ecological System Based on a Predatorâ€“Prey Model Extended by Gene Evolution


stealth reduces speed
speed has an impact on combat
sneaking up on an animal (they do not spot you, while you successfully spotted them) gives a modifier to attack roll
speed has an effect on the time it takes to move between tiles

Draw a numeral above each tile that has more than 0 animals on it, to allow reading animal movements, and identifying hotspots
 - new tilemaplayer with tileset made of numerals from 1 to 99

Points of interest:
 - start simulation with some predefined predator and prey example animal
   - attempt to make the population capable of balance (fluctuations instead of total collapse)

STOP USING PERLIN NOISE IN TileMap
use simplex or smooth simplex
